Twitchler
=========

A stupid attempt to watch Twitch.tv streams without the annoying
noise of your laptop fan desperately trying to prevent a critical cpu meltdown.

This app acts as a simple bridge between Twitch streams and Apple's QuickTime
Player X application. It registers a custom `twitch://` protocol. To run a stream
just enter a URL into your browser of choice (e.g. `twitch://<channelname>`).
